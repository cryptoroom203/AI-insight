Generated on: 2025-04-01 01:20:55

The year was 2030, and the world had changed dramatically since the days of open borders and free trade. The collapse of globalization, a silent revolution that had begun in earnest in the early 2020s, had left its indelible mark on every corner of the globe.

The seeds of this transformation were sown in the tumultuous years following the Great Recession of 2019. As nations grappled with economic instability and rising populism, protectionist policies began to take hold. The once-vaunted World Trade Organization, weakened by decades of neglect and erosion of its influence, was unable to stem the tide.

In March 2023, in an effort to stave off a looming economic crisis, President Trump imposed heavy tariffs on imported goods. The move sparked retaliation from trading partners around the world, setting off a chain reaction that would soon be known as the "Great Fragmentation."

As global stock markets plunged (see entry for March 24, 2025), governments scrambling to protect their own industries and citizens. By the end of 2023, most major economies had erected barriers to trade, effectively ending the era of globalization as we knew it.

In the years that followed, the world was plunged into chaos. Trade wars raged across continents, economic downturns deepened, and geopolitical tensions escalated. The once-flourishing interdependence between nations gave way to a patchwork of self-contained economies, each struggling to survive in an increasingly hostile world.

The collapse of globalization had far-reaching consequences for the political landscape as well. As borders closed and trade routes were severed, nationalist movements gained momentum, and authoritarian regimes rose to power. By 2030, many of the world's great democracies had been replaced by autocratic rule, their citizens yearning for stability in a tumultuous time.

The final nail in the coffin came with the dismantling of the World Trade Organization in 2027. The move was hailed as a triumph of national sovereignty by some, but it marked the end of any hope for a return to the open, interconnected world that had once been.

In the years that followed, humanity struggled to adapt to its new reality. Economies limped along at best, and resources grew scarcer as trade routes remained closed. The once-powerful United Nations was rendered impotent in the face of the new global order, leaving many to wonder what the future held.

But amidst the darkness, there were glimmers of hope. Small pockets of cooperation emerged between nations, driven by a shared recognition that the only way out of this crisis was together. And as the world slowly began to heal from the wounds inflicted by the collapse of globalization, one thing became abundantly clear: the human spirit is resilient, and we will find a way forward, no matter how difficult the journey may be.
