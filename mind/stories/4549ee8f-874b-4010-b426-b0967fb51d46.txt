In the year 2025, the world was grappling with the repercussions of failed globalization policies and the intensifying effects of protectionist tactics. The global economy teetered on the brink of collapse, as food crises escalated and resource wars broke out across continents.

The root cause of this catastrophic situation lay in the relentless pursuit of self-interest by powerful nations, who had prioritized their own economic gain over the wellbeing of the global community. Protectionist policies such as tariffs, subsidies, and export restrictions had crippled international trade, causing food prices to soar and resources to become scarce.

The United States, under President Trump's administration, was at the epicenter of this crisis. The White House had insisted that protectionist measures would make America richer and stronger, but in reality, they were driving up prices for consumers and creating a scarcity of essential resources.

As food prices spiraled out of control, protests erupted across the nation. People could no longer afford basic necessities, and tensions between communities grew increasingly volatile. In response to these social unrests, President Trump ordered the deployment of National Guard troops in several major cities.

Meanwhile, other nations struggled to cope with the fallout from failed globalization policies. India and China, two of the world's most populous countries, faced severe food shortages due to increased tariffs on agricultural imports. In an attempt to alleviate the crisis, both nations turned towards their neighbors for assistance, leading to a new era of resource wars.

Borders between countries became battlegrounds as resources such as water, land, and food were fought over with brutal intensity. In some regions, entire villages were emptied as rival nations seized control of scarce resources, causing massive displacement of people and deepening the humanitarian crisis.

Amidst this chaos, smaller nations began to band together in an effort to survive and assert their power on the global stage. The European Union, Africa's Southern African Development Community (SADC), and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) were among those who formed alliances to protect their interests and resources.

In a move that signified the death knell for globalization, these coalitions imposed strict export restrictions on essential goods, further exacerbating the food crisis and driving up prices. The situation became so dire that even the United Nations (UN) struggled to address the crisis effectively.

As the world grappled with this new reality, experts warned of a potential domino effect that could have far-reaching consequences for the global community. They predicted that the intensifying resource wars and food crises would lead to increased political instability, migration, and economic downturns in vulnerable regions.

In response to these dire predictions, some nations began to explore alternative models of development that prioritized cooperation and sustainability over self-interest and competition. These experiments in global governance focused on collaborative resource management, fair trade agreements, and humanitarian aid for the most affected communities.

However, the road ahead was fraught with challenges. Powerful nations continued to resist change, clinging to their outdated policies even as they faced growing criticism from within their own borders. The international community would need to work tirelessly to create a new world order that prioritized the wellbeing of all nations and ensured a more equitable distribution of resources.

As the global economy teetered on the brink of collapse, it became clear that the death of globalization was not an event but a process - one that would have profound and lasting impacts on humanity for generations to come.
