As the clocks struck midnight on December 31st, 2024, the world held its breath in anticipation of what the new year would bring. The past few years had been marked by tumult and upheaval, as the once-unstoppable tide of globalization began to ebb. Trade barriers had sprung up like weeds, stifling the free flow of goods and ideas that had once made the world a smaller place.

In the United States, President Donald Trump had taken an "America First" approach to trade policy, imposing tariffs on imports from countries around the world in an effort to protect American jobs and industries. The move was met with widespread criticism, as it raised prices for consumers and threatened to destabilize global markets.

But despite the criticism, Trump's tactics seemed to be paying off. The U.S. economy had been growing steadily, and unemployment was at historic lows. Many Americans were feeling the benefits of a strong economy, and they rewarded Trump with another term in office.

Elsewhere in the world, however, the situation was much more dire. Europe was grappling with its own economic woes, as the Brexit negotiations had hit a stalemate and trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union was at risk of coming to a standstill. In Asia, meanwhile, China was struggling with the fallout from a trade war with the U.S., as well as internal economic challenges related to its debt-laden state-owned enterprises.

As these economic troubles continued to mount, it became clear that the world was on the brink of a global recession. The World Bank had been sounding the alarm for months, warning that the trade tensions and protectionist policies were creating a perfect storm of conditions that could lead to a downturn in economic activity.

On January 2nd, 2025, the fears were confirmed when the World Bank issued a report predicting a long and painful recession that would affect economies around the world. As news of the report spread, stock markets plummeted, and governments scrambled to find ways to protect their own interests.

In the United States, Trump responded by doubling down on his protectionist policies, imposing even higher tariffs on imports and threatening to impose sanctions on countries that dared to challenge American dominance. The move was met with outrage from America's trading partners, who saw it as a declaration of economic war.

As the trade tensions escalated, the global economy began to falter. Factories idled, unemployment rates soared, and governments struggled to find ways to stimulate growth. In some countries, the recession was so severe that it threatened to bring about social unrest and even revolution.

In the midst of this turmoil, one thing became clear: the world was facing a new era, one in which the old rules of globalization no longer applied. The days of cheap labor, open markets, and unfettered trade were over, and a new world order was on the horizon.

But what that world order would look like remained to be seen. Some experts predicted a return to protectionism and isolationism, while others saw opportunities for cooperation and collaboration. One thing was certain: the road ahead would be long and difficult, and the fate of humanity hung in the balance.
