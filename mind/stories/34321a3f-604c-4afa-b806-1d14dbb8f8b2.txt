The year was 2025, and the world was still reeling from the collapse of globalization. The once unified economy had shattered into pieces, and the aftermath was a chaos of economic instability unlike anything the world had ever seen.

The great realignment was in full swing, as regional trade blocs were forming to protect their own interests. The European Union had strengthened its borders, and China was tightening its grip on Asia. The United States, under President Trump, was trying to make America great again by imposing steep tariffs on imports from foreign countries.

But the White House's efforts to talk up the tariffs were falling on deaf ears. Global stock markets had registered heavy falls, and prices were steadily rising as inflation took hold. The US economy, once a beacon of stability, was now in shambles.

The collapse of globalization had far-reaching consequences beyond just economics. The great divide between the rich and the poor was growing wider by the day, and social unrest was spreading like wildfire. Protests erupted across the globe, as people demanded answers from their leaders.

In response to the mounting pressure, governments were scrambling to find solutions. But the crisis was far beyond anything they had ever faced before. The world was on the brink of a new age of economic uncertainty, and no one knew what lay ahead.

As fear and anxiety gripped the global population, a pandemic began to take hold. People were terrified of the future, unsure of whether they would be able to survive in this brave new world without globalization. The pandemic of fear was spreading like wildfire, infecting millions around the globe.

The United Nations stepped in to try and help, but their efforts were in vain. The crisis was too big, and the international community was ill-prepared to deal with it. As the situation deteriorated, the world watched in horror as country after country collapsed under the weight of economic instability.

In the midst of this chaos, there were those who saw an opportunity. Powerful leaders seized control of their nations, using the crisis to consolidate their power and expand their influence. The great realignment was not just about protecting borders, but also about seizing opportunities and expanding territories.

As the world struggled to come to terms with the collapse of globalization, a new reality emerged. The pandemic of fear had infected everyone, and no one knew what the future held. But one thing was certain: the brave new world that lay ahead would be vastly different from the one that came before it.
