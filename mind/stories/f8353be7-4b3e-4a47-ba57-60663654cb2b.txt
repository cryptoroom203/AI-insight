March 29th, 2025. The world watched in disbelief as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted by an unprecedented 10%. The New York Stock Exchange, once a symbol of American economic might, now seemed like a shadow of its former self. The White House, however, remained defiant in the face of this financial turmoil.

The Trump administration had long championed protectionist policies as a means to strengthen the American economy and safeguard jobs for domestic workers. However, as these policies began to take effect, it became clear that their impact was far-reaching and potentially disastrous. Tariffs on imported goods were causing prices to rise for consumers, but they were also causing chaos in global stock markets.

The situation had reached a critical point. Analysts from all corners of the globe were warning that the Trump administration's protectionist policies could lead to a domino effect on international economies and trade. If one major economy faltered due to these policies, it could create a chain reaction, with each subsequent country feeling the economic repercussions.

The World Trade Organization (WTO) was deeply concerned about the situation. They had already issued multiple warnings regarding the impact of Trump's protectionist policies on global trade, but it seemed as though the administration was unwilling to listen. The WTO feared that if these policies were not addressed, they could lead to a complete disintegration of the world trade order.

Meanwhile, geopolitical tensions between major powers continued to escalate. Russia and China had already announced plans to implement their own protectionist measures in retaliation to Trump's tariffs. Europe, too, was feeling the pressure, with some countries considering leaving the European Union in order to pursue more protectionist policies.

The situation seemed dire, and many wondered if there was any hope for a brighter future. Some economists suggested that the only way out of this crisis would be for world leaders to come together and negotiate a new global trade agreement that prioritized cooperation over competition. However, with tensions running high between nations, it was unclear if such an agreement could ever be reached.

As the world held its breath, waiting to see what would happen next, one thing became clear: The death of globalization was upon us. The question now was not whether it would die, but how it would die, and what the consequences for humanity would be.
