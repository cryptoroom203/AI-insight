TL;DR: Globalization, the driving force behind economic growth and international cooperation for decades, is on its deathbed. As a result, the world economy is expected to plunge into chaos, with widespread famine, economic isolationism, and anarchy predicted.

In recent years, we have witnessed a slow but steady decline of globalization, with protectionist policies and nationalistic sentiments gaining traction worldwide. This trend accelerated in 2025, as countries started to fortify their borders, erecting trade barriers and restricting immigration.

The White House's imposition of tariffs on various imports was the final nail in globalization's coffin. The move sparked a series of retaliatory measures from other nations, leading to a global trade war that crippled economies and sent shockwaves through financial markets.

Stock markets around the world registered heavy falls, with investors scrambling to sell their holdings in fear of further losses. The once vibrant international trade scene was replaced by isolationism, as nations focused on protecting their own interests rather than collaborating for global growth.

The consequences of this economic decline were catastrophic. Food prices skyrocketed due to disrupted supply chains and increased tariffs on agricultural products. This led to widespread famine in developing countries, where millions struggled to secure even the most basic necessities.

Governments scrambled to provide aid, but their efforts were overshadowed by growing economic instability. Currencies plummeted, leading to hyperinflation and further eroding the purchasing power of already struggling populations.

In the face of this chaos, international cooperation dissipated. Diplomatic relations between nations deteriorated, as leaders focused on protecting their own citizens rather than working together for global stability.

As a result, the world was plunged into an era of economic anarchy. Borders were closed, currencies devalued, and trade routes disrupted, leading to a fractured world on the brink of collapse.

It was a dark time for humanity, as the benefits of globalization were replaced by suffering and despair. Yet, amidst the chaos, there were glimmers of hope.

Some countries, recognizing the need for international cooperation, continued to work together despite the mounting challenges. They sought to rebuild the shattered fragments of globalization, hoping to restore some semblance of order in a world teetering on the brink of chaos.

But the road ahead was long and fraught with obstacles. The task of reviving globalization would require immense effort, collaboration, and sacrifice. However, it was a challenge that humanity could not afford to ignore if it wanted to secure its future and preserve the hard-won progress of generations past.
