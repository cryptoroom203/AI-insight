In the small village of San Martin, nestled in the hills of Nicaragua, farmers have been struggling to make ends meet for months. With international trade at an all-time low, they are unable to sell their crops and are facing food shortages in their own homes.

   "We used to be able to sell our beans and corn to other countries and make a good living," said Maria, a farmer in San Martin. "But now, with the tariffs and quotas that other countries have put in place, we can't even sell our crops locally."

   The village, once bustling with activity and prosperity, has become a ghost town. Houses stand empty as their owners seek work elsewhere, and fields lie fallow as crops rot in the sun.

   Meanwhile, in the United States, President Trump is facing criticism for his protectionist policies, which have led to heavy falls on global stock markets. With the economy in turmoil, many are questioning whether these tariffs will ultimately make America money or simply drive up prices for consumers.

   In an attempt to appease the public and counter criticism of his policies, Trump has taken to social media to tout the supposed benefits of protectionism. "America First!" he tweeted recently, followed by a string of charts and graphs purporting to show the economic benefits of his tariffs.

   However, many economists are skeptical of these claims. They argue that while Trump's policies may boost domestic industries in the short term, they will ultimately lead to a decline in innovation and productivity, as well as increased prices for consumers.

   "It's a dangerous game that President Trump is playing," said Dr. Jane Smith, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. "By shutting out foreign competition, he is putting American industries at risk of becoming complacent and stagnating. This could have devastating consequences for the global economy."

   As the world grapples with the impact of collapsed trade deals and escalating protectionist policies, it remains to be seen how this crisis will unfold. One thing is certain: the collapse of globalization is having a profound impact on the lives of people around the world, and the consequences could be far-reaching and devastating.
