TL;DR: In the wake of the disintegration of globalization, the world economy is on the brink of a Great Recession not seen since the 1930s. With nations scrambling to adapt in this rapidly evolving world order, many wonder what the future holds for humanity as a whole.

As October 2025 dawned, the specter of economic isolationism continued to cast a long shadow over the global economy. In Washington, D.C., President Trump found himself increasingly isolated, his attempts to shore up support for his tariffs policy failing to gain traction with both domestic and foreign leaders.

In Europe, the formation of a European Union superstate proved to be a double-edged sword, providing some level of economic stability but also stoking fears of increased bureaucracy and centralization. Meanwhile, in Asia, nations like China and Japan struggled to maintain their economic dominance amidst growing competition from rising powers like India and Russia.

The world stood on the brink of an uncertain future, as the consequences of the disintegration of globalization were far-reaching and profound. In an attempt to turn the tide, President Trump's trusted advisor Jared Kushner had proposed a bold new initiative aimed at revitalizing the global economy. The plan involved the creation of a network of regional trading blocs, designed to insulate nations from the worst effects of economic isolationism.

However, as the details of the proposal began to emerge, it became clear that Kushner's plan was not without its critics. Many argued that such a move would only serve to further entrench protectionist policies and stoke nationalistic sentiments, ultimately hindering the recovery of the global economy.

As the days wore on, tensions between the US and its international partners continued to escalate, as each side sought to assert its dominance in an increasingly fractured world.

In Washington, D.C., the White House continued its push for tariffs, even as it faced mounting criticism from both domestic and foreign leaders. However, the growing economic instability served only to further erode confidence in President Trump's administration.
