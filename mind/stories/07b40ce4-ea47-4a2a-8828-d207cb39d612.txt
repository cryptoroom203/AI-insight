The year was 2026. The world had changed dramatically since the collapse of globalization. Economies teetered on the brink of recession as nations turned inward, focusing on their own interests and protectionism. The once-interconnected web of global trade had become a tangled mess, with countries imposing tariffs and barriers to keep out foreign competition.

In the United States, President Martinez faced a daunting challenge. The country's economy was struggling, with rising prices due to the tariffs imposed by other nations. Unemployment was on the rise, and many Americans were feeling the squeeze. Despite this, Martinez insisted that the tariffs would ultimately make the US money, and he vowed to continue pushing for protectionist policies.

Across the Atlantic, European leaders were grappling with their own economic woes. The continent was fragmented, with countries divided over how to respond to the changing global landscape. Some advocated for closer integration and collaboration, while others called for independence and self-reliance.

Meanwhile, in Asia, the once-booming economies of China and India were feeling the strain. With the United States turning away from free trade, these nations found themselves at a crossroads. They could either continue down the path of protectionism, risking further isolation and economic decline, or find new partners and forge alliances to sustain their growth.

The ripple effects of these decisions were felt far beyond the shores of the countries making them. In Africa, where economies had long been dependent on exports to Europe and America, the sudden shift in trade policies left many struggling to survive. The same was true in Latin America, where countries reliant on agricultural exports found themselves at the mercy of protectionist tariffs imposed by the United States.

As the global recession deepened, tensions between nations began to rise. Trade disputes escalated into diplomatic spats, and even into military confrontations in some cases. The world had entered a new era, one marked by economic instability, uncertainty, and conflict.

In response to this growing chaos, some leaders called for a return to globalization, arguing that only through collaboration could the world hope to weather the storm. But others were not so sure. They pointed to the many injustices perpetuated by the old system of global trade, from exploitation of workers in developing countries to environmental destruction and rampant inequality.

In the end, it was clear that the old order had passed, and a new one was emerging. The challenge facing humanity was immense: how to forge a world where all could thrive, while avoiding the pitfalls of the past. It would not be an easy task, but if there was one thing that the collapse of globalization had taught us, it was that change was inevitable.
